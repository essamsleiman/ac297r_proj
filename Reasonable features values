Mean blood pressure: normal 65 or 70 up to ~100 mmHg
Systolic blood pressure : normal 120-140 mmHg
O2 saturation: anything above 94%
Urine volume : target in sepsis is > 0.5 ml/kg/h (based on actual patient’s body weight)
FiO2: normally 21%, can go as high as 100% in severe lung conditions such as pneumonia. acute respiratory distress syndrome or pulmonary oedema
Lactate: Normal lactate levels are less than two mmol/L, with hyperlactatemia defined as lactate levels between 2 mmol/L and 4 mmol/L. Severe levels of lactate are 4 mmol/L or higher.
RBC count pleural fluid : normal <100 RBC/microliter
RBC count CSF: normal is 0
RBC count ascites: A reference RBC count is not well established in the literature.
RBC count urine: <=4 red blood cells per high power field (RBC/HPF)
Total vasopressor. this is dictated by clinicians’ actions and patient severity. there’s no normal range. if you’re healthy, it’s zero.
LDH : 105 to 333 international units per liter (IU/L).
Fibrinogen : Fibrinogen is a soluble protein in the plasma that is broken down to fibrin by the enzyme thrombin to form clots. The normal range is 200 to 400 mg/dL (2.0 to 4.0 g/L).
ASAT (liver enzyme) :10 to 40 units per liter
Platelets :150 000 to 400 000 platelets/microliter of blood = 150 to 400 × 10^9/L
ALAT (liver enzyme): 7 to 56 units per liter.
Tidal volume spontaneous. In healthy lungs, when you’re spontaneously breathing, it is around 7 ml/kg of ideal body weight
Alkaline phosphatase: 44 to 147 international units per liter (IU/L)
Calcium: 8.5 to 10.2 mg/dL (2.13 to 2.55 millimol/L). [ionized calcium has a different range: 4.5-5.6 mg/dL or 1.05-1.3 mmol/L]
Diastolic blood pressure: 60- 80 mmHg
